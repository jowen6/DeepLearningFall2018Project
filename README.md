# DeepLearningFall2018Project
Practice code and project code used for Fall 2018 Deep Learning course\

Class Project:\
The purpose of this project is to see if we can apply a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to vector field data to determine if it is divergence free or not.
VectorFieldClassifier.py is the main file.\
VFields.py is a module for generating vector fields.\
DataGeneratignScript.py is just a script for testing VFields.py.\

Universal Approximation Theorem:\
FunctionApproximationNetwork.py is just a simple regression example.
